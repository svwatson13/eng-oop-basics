# OOP Basics :taco:

This class is going to cover the basics of OOP

### Covered in this class:

**4 Pillars**:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

Other learning outcomes:
- Git + GitHub
- Documentation with Mark Down
- Best practises and organisation

### Definitions 

- **Class:** Blueprint of an object - cookie cutter for objects - wraps it's methods and attributes
- **Methods:** Just like functions, they can take in arguments and run a block of code, however, 
               they can only be used by an instance of it's class 
- **Attributes:** Hold information about our SPECIFIC object and are set in the def _ _init_ _() method
                  with arguments like any other function
- **__ init_ _():** AKA - constructor or initaliser - this method runs everytime an object is created
                    so when you do:
 ````
                    anima1 = Animal('Fred', 10, 2)
````
- **Instance/ Object:** It is an occurance of an object - like different humans
- **Self:** Refers to the instance
- **Inheritance:** The ability of classes to inherity characteristics(parameters) and behaviours(methods) 
                    from parent class
- **Polymorphism:** Poly means many and morph means forms so many forms - OOP polymorphism is for 
                    the ability to change methods and characteristics of instances of child classes 
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity from the user - changing gears in a car

## Specific to us, we will:
- Write nice documentation for how to import and use our code
- Use inheritance and importing to hide the code
- Ultimately we can package it into a module that could be imported with PIP
